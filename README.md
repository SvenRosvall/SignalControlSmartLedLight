# SignalControlSmartLedLight
An extension to the SignalControl library to support 
smart LEDs such as NeoPixel.

The example sketch Signal4Aspect shows how to create a
modern 4 aspect signal with only 2 apertures. 
The lower aperture can show red, green or yellow. 
The upper aperture can only show yellow and is used for 
double yellow aspect.
